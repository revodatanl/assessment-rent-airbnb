# PySpark

## Why Use PySpark?

For this project, we decided to use **PySpark** for processing and analyzing large-scale datasets. Here's why:

1. **Scalability:**
   - PySpark is designed to handle massive datasets by distributing tasks across multiple nodes in a cluster. Even as the size of rental datasets increases, PySpark will be able to efficiently process the data without running into performance bottlenecks.
   - **Why This Is Important:**
     - With large-scale data, traditional processing tools like pandas or Excel become inefficient and impractical. PySpark allows us to scale our pipeline as the data grows, ensuring long-term usability and performance.

2. **Distributed Processing:**
   - PySpark enables parallel processing, which significantly speeds up data transformations and analysis.
   - **Why This Is Important:**
     - As the dataset expands, distributed processing ensures that we can still perform complex computations quickly and efficiently, reducing the overall time to generate insights.

3. **Integration with Big Data Ecosystems:**
   - PySpark integrates well with big data tools and file formats like Databricks and Parquet.
   - **Why This Is Important:**
     - It ensures that the pipeline can handle various data sources, whether local, cloud-based, or in distributed storage, and store the processed results in an efficient, accessible format.
